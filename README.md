<h1>Vert</h1>
<h2>Why use Vert instead of Bolt?</h2>
<p>Vert offers more features that can help prevent detection from school districts, and other places.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Vert runs on the same proxies as Bolt, Ultraviolet, Scramjet, and Rammerhead. The most basic form is just routing info through a server, to make it not possible to read on the blocker's side.</p>
<h2>How do I deploy Vert?</h2>
<p>Again, it works the same as deploying from Bolt, you can use a decently sized list of services, but I recommend checking this same page on the Bolt repository.</p>
